                <p>The Binary Holdings is Web3 infrastructure platform for Telecommunication and Banks in emerging economies across Southeast Asia, Africa, South Asia and Latam with over 40m users currently.</p>

                <br/><p>In essence, The Binary Holdings becomes the middleware or a backend for telcos and banks, that allows them to leverage our extensive ecosystem. This enables these legacy industries to enhance their services, streamline operations, and provide additional value to their customers through The Binary Holdings infrastructure, effectively embedding our ecosystem into their own service offerings.</p>

        question: "What is The Binary Network?",
        answer: `<div>
                <p>The Binary Network is a Layer2 solution built by The Binary Holdings on the Optimism stack. It acts as a bridge between Web2 and Web3, integrating directly into telecommunications and banking applications. This integration allows for the development and deployment of various decentralized applications (dApps), which are currently used by over 40 million users.</p>
                </div>`,

      {
        question:
          "Why is The Binary Network Built on Optimism's OP Tech Stack?",
        answer: `<div>
                <p>The Binary Network is built on the Optimism (OP) tech stack to effectively serve both users and dApp developers with a scalable blockchain solution. The OP stack, known for its EVM compatibility, allows seamless integration with telecom providers and handles large-scale transactions while remaining developer-friendly. Optimism, being the most mature solution for optimistic rollups, aligns closely with Ethereum's values and ecosystem. This alignment ensures that The Binary Network can leverage Ethereum's larger ecosystem, making it the ideal choice for scalability, ease of dApp integration, and future growth.</p>

      {
        question:
          "How can I build on The Binary Network and why should I choose it to build dApps?",
        answer: `<div>
                <p>To start building on The Binary Network, refer to our comprehensive guide: <a class="underline" href="https://docs.thebinaryholdings.com/" target="_blank">Get Started Here.</a> </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Choosing The Binary Network offers unique advantages:</p>
                <br/>
                <ul class="list-disc px-10">
                  <li><b class="font-bold">Massive User Base</b>: As the only Layer 2 solution with 40 million users, your dApps will have instant access to a vast audience, unmatched by any other Layer 2 solution.</li>
                  <li><b class="font-bold">Seamless Integration</b>: Our network supports easy and efficient deployment of dApps, providing a scalable and developer-friendly environment.</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>By building on The Binary Network, you tap into a robust infrastructure and a ready-made user base, maximising your dApp's potential for success.</p>

        question: "How reliable is the network?",
        answer: `<span>
                  <p>The reliability of The Binary Network is anchored in its use of the Optimism tech stack, which employs optimistic rollup technology to enhance scalability and transaction efficiency.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>Transactions from Layer 1 (L1) to Layer 2 (L2) on The Binary Network typically take up to 3 minutes, showcasing its capability to swiftly process and confirm operations.</p>
                  <br/> 
                  <p>However, when moving from Layer 2 back to Layer 1 (L2 to L1), the finality process involves waiting for approximately 7 days due to Ethereum's confirmation requirements.</p>
