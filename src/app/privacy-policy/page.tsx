      <p className="mt-5 leading-6 text-white/75">
        <b className="text-white">Use of Cookies:</b> To improve the
        effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use
        “cookies”, or such similar electronic tools to collect information to
        assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification
        (User ID) to understand the User’s individual interests using the
        identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies
        himself/herself (e.g., through registration), TBH has no direct way of
        knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User’s
        computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is
        information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the
        User’s hard drive. TBH’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies
        to the User’s browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a
        process that TBH does not control.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5 leading-6 text-white/75">
        TBH’s web servers automatically collect limited information about User’s
        computer’s connection to the Internet, including User’s IP address, when
        the User visits the Portal. (User’s IP address is a number that lets
        computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User —
        such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User’s IP address does
        not identify the User personally and rather identify the IP of the
        device being used. TBH uses this information to deliver its web pages to
        Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users,
        to measure traffic within the Portal and let advertisers know the
        geographic locations from where TBHs visitors come.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5 leading-6 text-white/75">
        <b className="text-white">Links to Third party websites:</b> TBH also
        includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their
        respective privacy policies, which are beyond TBH’s control. Once the
        User leaves TBH’s servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking
        the URL in the location bar on the User’s browser), use of any
        information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of
        the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may
        differ from TBH’s own. If the User can’t find the privacy policy of any
        of these sites via a link from the site’s homepage, the User may contact
        the site directly for more information. TBH is not responsible for the
        privacy practices or the content of such websites.

        gathered on TBH is stored within TBH - controlled database and we take
        reasonable and appropriate steps to protect such information. The
        database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to such
        servers being password-protected and strictly limited based on
        need-to-know basis. However, we understand that as effective as our
        security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Thus, we
        cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that
        information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted
        to us over the Internet. Further, any information you include in a
        posting to the discussion areas will be available to anyone with
        Internet access. By using the Portal, you understand and agree that your
        information may be used in or transferred to countries worldwide. We
        also use third party suppliers from time to time to run our
        infrastructure and databases.

        TBH also believes that the internet is an ever-evolving medium. We may
        periodically review from time to time and change our privacy policy to
        incorporate such future changes as may be considered appropriate,
        without any notice to you. You should check our Privacy Policy from time
        to time to stay updated on the changes. Our use of any information we
        gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the
        information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be. Any
        changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page, so you are

        to its online advertisers — to help them understand our audience and
        confirm the value of advertising on the Portal — it is usually in the
        form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our
        site. When you register with TBH, we contact you from time to time about
        updating your content to provide features which we believe may benefit
        you. We may also use information for personalized advertising from time
        to time.

        Several deceptive emails, websites, blogs etc. claiming to be from or
        associated with TBH may or are circulating on the Internet. These
        emails, websites, blogs etc. often include our logo, photos, links,
        content or other information. Some emails, websites, blogs etc. call the
        user to provide login name, password etc. or that the user has won a

              exchange of your loyalty program currency from one program
              (“program A”) to another program (“program B”), you must be a
              member of both programs. We will first redeem your currency from
              program A on your behalf and then use the proceeds from that
              transaction, net of our commission, and any applicable taxes, to
              purchase the maximum amount of currency in program B possible. The
              rate you receive from program A for redeeming your currency and
              the rate charged by program B to acquire currency are determined
              by the applicable loyalty programs and not by us. With certain
              exceptions, we generally charge a commission of 15% on the
              proceeds from the redemption of currency from program A.

        We use session cookies and tokens to make it easier for you to navigate
        our Sites. We use persistent cookies and tokens to store your username,
        so you don’t have to enter it more than once, and to track and target
        your interests, to evaluate the performance of our Sites, and to tailor
        promotions and other marketing messages to you and enhance your

        <b className="text-white">Clear Gifs</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Clear gifs (also known as tracking pixels or web beacons) are tiny
        graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. They
        are used to track the online movements of users. In contrast to cookies,
        which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are
        embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at
        the end of this sentence.
        <br />
        We and our service providers use clear gifs to help us better manage
        content on our Sites, by informing us what content is effective, and to
        gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing
        campaigns. For instance, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to
        let us know which emails have been opened by recipients and to allow us
        to serve you related advertising on the Internet.

        <b className="text-white">Security Measures</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        We take reasonable measures, including administrative, physical and
        technical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft,
        misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

        industry standard encryption, which creates a private conversation

        enable TLS/SSL encryption to protect your sensitive data and
        transactions.
        <br />
        Nevertheless, TBH cannot absolutely guarantee that unauthorized third
        parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your
        personal information for improper purposes. In the event that your
        personal information in our possession or under our control is
        compromised as a result of a security breach, we will take reasonable
        steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, notify you
        and take other steps in accordance with applicable laws or regulations.
        <br />
        Remember that email sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted and
        transmitted in clear text. We recommend that you use caution when
        forwarding free-format email messages to us and that you do not include
        confidential information (such as unique user IDs, passwords or
        personally identifiable information) in those messages. Confidential
        information should be transmitted to us through other secure methods
        such as by telephone.
